			ui_description="These sands can shift, but a catalyst must be provided as motivation. 
First hunt down the legs in the pyramid, the sands will shift.
Then crack the jungle egg, the sands will shift.
Kill the one with three eyes, the sands will shift.
Next you must slay the robot spider, the sands will shift.
Finally you must take on the one with the misleading name, the sands will shimmer with your success."
