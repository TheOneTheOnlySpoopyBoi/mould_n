     Custom Wand Template
================================
There is very little (or no) documentation
about modding Noita, So I've created this
VREY BASIC modding template to help myself,
and now hopefully others, learn how all this
works.

Here is a super quick rundown of how to create wands.

NOTE:  I couldn't figure out how to do "always casts" spells yet. Sorry.

NOTE2: Numbers for things like "Cast delay" are not in the same units as in game.
	   Setting 'cast delay' to 1 in xml for example, makes the in-game cast delay 0.02.

================================
        Wand stats
================================
    Here are the stats most
	people would want to mod,
	in same order as listed in
    wand gui's

	
ui_name=""
	- Display Name of the wand

shuffle_deck_when_empty=""
	- Shuffle
	  - 1 = Shuffle
	  - 0 = No Shuffle

actions_per_round=""
    - Spells/Cast
	- How many spells per cast

fire_rate_wait=""
	- Cast Delay

reload_time=""
	- recharge time
	
mana_max=""
	- Self explanitory

mana_charge_speed=""
	- Self Explanitory

deck_capacity=""
    - Capacity
    - Number of spell slots

spread_degrees
	- spread
	- how much projectiles spread


======================
	Adding spells
======================
Spells are added at:

	add_these_child_actions=""
	
There is a Complete(?) list of all spells at the bottom of this document.
Enter the spells you want in all caps, seperated by a comma, all conatined in the quotes.

for example:

add_these_child_actions="BURST_2,LASER,LASER"

Will add 'double spell' in slot one of the wand, and "conentrated light" in slots 2 and 3.
Note that the Spell names are not the same as In-game. Reference the list below

======================
	Custom Sprite
======================
Wands can have custom sprites.
Image Must be .png with transparency (most likely...)
Wand dimensions must be even (not sure about this, all others are)
Place your .png files in this directory:

	data/items_gfx/my_wand.png

All wands contain a .xml File with the same name as the image. It contains render/draw type info, I never had to mess with it.
Just make sure there is always a copy of that .xml with the same name as your custom wand. like:
my_wand.png
my_wand.xml

========================
	 Other/Advanced
========================

Consider everything else advaned, and outside the scope of this template.
Lines that were not mentioned do not need to be modified.
