<Mod
name="Mould"
description="
An expansion primarily based around hunting and exploration.

[b] This mod is (mostly) abandoned. However I may still add compatibilities between specific biome mods within this mod but probably not too many as it will become exponentially more work.[/b]

[list]
[*] A 3rd Sun
[*] 7 new spells and 7 returning spells
[*] 31 weapons and wands
[*] New biomes: Coral Reef (thanks to Spoopy), Cursed Sandcave, Prawn Cave
